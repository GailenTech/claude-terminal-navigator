# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Terminal Navigator will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-07-25

### Added
- **ðŸš¨ Session Attention Alert System**: Revolutionary new feature that alerts when Claude sessions need user attention
- **Smart Transition Detection**: Monitors CPU usage patterns to detect when sessions go from busy to idle
- **Focus-Aware Alerts**: Only shows alerts for sessions that are NOT currently visible/focused
- **Intelligent Badge System**: Compact ðŸš¨ badge in menu bar for sessions requiring attention
- **Priority Sorting**: Sessions needing attention always appear first in all lists and views
- **AppleScript Focus Detection**: Deep Terminal.app integration to detect which session is currently active

### Changed
- **Consistent Iconography**: Unified ðŸš¨ emergency icon across menu bar, detailed view, and dropdown menus
- **Ultra-Compact Badge**: Optimized badge width to avoid camera notch issues on modern MacBooks
- **Immediate Alert Clearing**: Attention flags clear instantly when user interacts with flagged sessions
- **Reduced Protection Period**: Lowered manual attention clearing protection from 30s to 10s for better UX

### Fixed
- **Eliminated UI Race Conditions**: Fixed concurrent session updates that caused inconsistent sorting ("dancing" behavior)
- **Consistent Session Ordering**: All views now maintain proper sorting: attention â†’ active â†’ idle
- **CPU Reading Accumulation**: Fixed critical bug where CPU readings weren't properly accumulated for transition detection
- **Focus Detection Reliability**: Improved AppleScript integration for accurate session focus detection

### Technical
- Implemented thread-safe session update queue to prevent concurrent modifications
- Added comprehensive debugging logs for attention state tracking and transitions
- Enhanced session state persistence across refresh cycles
- Optimized attention logic with proper transition validation (requires 3+ readings with prior activity)
- 5-second delay before triggering attention alerts to prevent false positives

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-25

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- **Session Caching**: Implemented intelligent session caching system for instant window display
- **Auto-refresh**: Detail window now automatically updates when cache refreshes (every 5 seconds)
- **Cache Age Indicator**: Shows when cached data is being displayed (only when meaningful, >2 seconds)

### Changed
- **Single-Click Navigation**: Simplified from double-click to single-click for jumping to sessions
- **Instant Window Display**: Detail window now opens immediately with cached data instead of showing loading state
- **Improved Performance**: Window appears instantly, fresh data loads in background

### Fixed
- **Scroll Position Preservation**: Scroll position is now properly maintained during auto-refresh
- **Cache UX**: Removed unhelpful "cached 0s ago" messages
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of scroll view references to prevent memory leaks

### Technical
- Implemented in-place content updates to preserve UI state
- Added smooth fade transitions when updating from cache to fresh data
- Optimized session comparison logic to detect meaningful changes
