# ðŸ“” Development Diary - Claude Terminal Navigator

## 2025-07-21 - Session Cache Implementation

### What was done
- Implemented complete session caching system for instant window display
- Added cache update mechanism in the 5-second refresh cycle
- Window now shows cached sessions immediately on open
- Fresh data loads asynchronously and updates if different
- Added cache age indicator in header (e.g., "cached 3s ago")
- Implemented smooth fade transition when updating from cache to fresh data
- Added auto-refresh for open detail window when cache updates

### Decisions made
- Cache updates every 5 seconds with the regular refresh cycle
- Used sessionEqual() helper to detect meaningful changes in sessions
- Show cache age to users for transparency
- Fade animation (0.25s) provides visual feedback on data updates

### Challenges/Learnings
- Swift Array comparison requires Equatable conformance - used custom comparison function
- Showing cached data first dramatically improves perceived performance
- Auto-refresh keeps window data current without user interaction

### Next steps
- Consider persisting cache between app launches
- Add visual indicator (spinner) when refreshing in background
- Implement cache expiration policy if needed

## 2025-07-19 - UX Improvements: Single-Click Navigation & Performance

### What was done
- Changed double-click to single-click for session navigation
- Improved window opening performance by showing UI immediately
- Added loading indicator while sessions are being fetched
- Window now appears instantly with "Loading sessions..." message
- Sessions are loaded asynchronously and UI updates when ready

### Decisions made
- Single-click is more intuitive and faster for users
- Show UI immediately rather than waiting for data (perceived performance)
- Use NSProgressIndicator for visual feedback during loading

### Challenges/Learnings
- Async loading pattern prevents UI blocking
- Perceived performance is as important as actual performance
- Simple UX changes can significantly improve user experience

## 2025-07-19 - Major Release: Session Analytics & DMG Installer

### What was done
- Implemented complete session analytics system with SQLite database
- Created real-time metrics collection (CPU, memory, duration)
- Added analytics dashboard with time period selector (24h, 7d, 30d, all time)
- Built professional DMG installer with drag-and-drop interface
- Fixed scroll position issue using FlippedView implementation
- Added window toggle behavior (click menu bar icon to close)
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow for releases

### Decisions made
- Chose SQLite for local session storage (lightweight, no dependencies)
- Used FlippedView pattern to fix macOS coordinate system issues
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow that creates both ZIP and DMG
- Version now updates automatically from git tags
- Build number uses GitHub run number for auto-increment

### Challenges/Learnings
- Swift concurrency error in release builds - fixed by capturing variables before async blocks
- GitHub Actions icon copy error - resolved by checking if file exists first
- NSScrollView coordinate system is bottom-up by default - FlippedView solves this elegantly
- DMG creation requires `create-dmg` tool - added to workflow

### Next steps
- Add performance metrics (disk I/O, network) - currently pending
- Consider adding export functionality for analytics data
- Implement session search/filter capabilities
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

## 2025-07-18 - Session Metrics Proposal

### What was done
- Created comprehensive metrics proposal document
- Designed database schema for session history
- Planned SessionTracker and analytics implementation

### Decisions made
- Track sessions locally vs cloud storage
- Use native Swift/AppKit for all UI components
- Implement non-intrusive background tracking

## 2025-07-17 - Initial Release v1.0.0

### What was done
- Transformed from shell script-based tool to native Swift application
- Implemented automatic Claude session detection
- Added real-time CPU and memory monitoring
- Created floating detailed view window
- Added Git branch and status information display

### Decisions made
- Moved from bash scripts to native macOS app for better integration
- Used SwiftUI/AppKit hybrid approach
- Removed all shell script dependencies for cleaner architecture

### Challenges/Learnings
- Process discovery required multiple fallback methods
- Working directory detection needed special handling for lsof output
- macOS permissions for Terminal control require user approval
