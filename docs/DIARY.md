# ðŸ“” Development Diary - Claude Terminal Navigator

## 2025-01-19 - Major Release: Session Analytics & DMG Installer

### What was done
- Implemented complete session analytics system with SQLite database
- Created real-time metrics collection (CPU, memory, duration)
- Added analytics dashboard with time period selector (24h, 7d, 30d, all time)
- Built professional DMG installer with drag-and-drop interface
- Fixed scroll position issue using FlippedView implementation
- Added window toggle behavior (click menu bar icon to close)
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow for releases

### Decisions made
- Chose SQLite for local session storage (lightweight, no dependencies)
- Used FlippedView pattern to fix macOS coordinate system issues
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow that creates both ZIP and DMG
- Version now updates automatically from git tags
- Build number uses GitHub run number for auto-increment

### Challenges/Learnings
- Swift concurrency error in release builds - fixed by capturing variables before async blocks
- GitHub Actions icon copy error - resolved by checking if file exists first
- NSScrollView coordinate system is bottom-up by default - FlippedView solves this elegantly
- DMG creation requires `create-dmg` tool - added to workflow

### Next steps
- Add performance metrics (disk I/O, network) - currently pending
- Consider adding export functionality for analytics data
- Implement session search/filter capabilities
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

## 2025-01-18 - Session Metrics Proposal

### What was done
- Created comprehensive metrics proposal document
- Designed database schema for session history
- Planned SessionTracker and analytics implementation

### Decisions made
- Track sessions locally vs cloud storage
- Use native Swift/AppKit for all UI components
- Implement non-intrusive background tracking

## 2025-01-17 - Initial Release v1.0.0

### What was done
- Transformed from shell script-based tool to native Swift application
- Implemented automatic Claude session detection
- Added real-time CPU and memory monitoring
- Created floating detailed view window
- Added Git branch and status information display

### Decisions made
- Moved from bash scripts to native macOS app for better integration
- Used SwiftUI/AppKit hybrid approach
- Removed all shell script dependencies for cleaner architecture

### Challenges/Learnings
- Process discovery required multiple fallback methods
- Working directory detection needed special handling for lsof output
- macOS permissions for Terminal control require user approval
